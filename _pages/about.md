I am an Integrated Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University (SNU), Republic of Korea. 
My advisor is Prof. Jung Hee Cheon. 
I work on cryptography, currently focusing on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and its applications, including privacy-preserving machine learning.
